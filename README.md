# Application Overview
This is a Universal Windows Application(UWP), that has been designed for College Students to help them keep track of various events, tasks and priorities within an educational / college type environment. The application allows users to enter new events and details and save them to the cloud. _(This needs to be fixed)_ => **[When offline, the data is stored locally and will sync with cloud when the user is in a sync enabled environment]** 
The application also allows users to create events with certain priority level. These priority levels and a count for each level are displayed for the user that allows them to visualise the amount of task by priority level. 

The app is straightforward and easy to use. Below is a breakdown of the controls on the visual display and how they operate:

| *Control Type* | *Function*      |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| **Event / Module Name**    | Here you enter the Module or subject associated with the event  |
| **Deadline**         | This is broken up into various drop down lists [Day, Date, Month, Year] |
| **Percentage of Module**      | This is how much of your subject is impacted by this percentage. Leave at 0% if not relevant |
| **Priorty Level**  | There are 4 different levels [URGENT, NORMAL, LOW, None] |
| **Add** | Adds an event to your list and immediately displays that event in the list event list area |
| **Sync** | Performs a sync with the Cloud server (Azure). Any existing events will be retrieved and displayed in the list area |
